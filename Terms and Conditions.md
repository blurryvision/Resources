# Terms and Conditions

Please read the below thoroughly, as well as all [Store Rules](https://github.com/blurryvision/Resources/blob/main/Terms%20and%20Conditions.md#store-rules), and the product information for the product you're interested in before making a purchase.

## General Terms and Conditions:
1. Do **NOT** redistribute any files from my products, services, or related channels. If you'd like to purchase for someone else, see [Store Rules](https://github.com/blurryvision/Resources/blob/main/Terms%20and%20Conditions.md#store-rules).
2. Do **NOT** use commercially without permission, such as selling on an avatar or offering it as a service or upsell in an upload or commission.
3. Do **NOT** use on public releases or uploads without permission.
4. Do **NOT** claim or resell as your own.
5. Commercial commissions do not include commercial rights to the commission client. Commercial licenses are required for all parties **making revenue**, whether that be being a creator offering services to install a product, a creator selling an avatar with the product, or both.
6. Products will be updated and supported for as long as possible, but I am not liable for any changes made by Unity or VRChat that deprecate any features or functionality via software/game updates.
7. I am **NOT** responsible for keeping products up to date indefinitely. If my store closes, updates will be released to support stable long-term usage.
8. If you are **BANNED** from my server, you may NOT use any of my products commercially.
9. You must credit when used for commercial usage or media (assuming you have commercial permission/license). Credit in personal usage would be appreciated.

## Asset Product Terms and Conditions:
1. **All [General Terms and Conditions](https://github.com/blurryvision/Resources/blob/main/Terms%20and%20Conditions.md#general-terms-and-conditions) above apply**
2. Do **NOT** use commercially unless you have permission (such as a commercial license)
3. Do **NOT** resell alone. It must be used as part of a whole model if you have a commercial license.
4. Do **NOT** resell as part of a product whose cost is cheaper than the license price of the asset.
